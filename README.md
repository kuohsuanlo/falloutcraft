Mechanism :

====Fatigue====

Increase when time passes. 50 to 100(RNG based) per 20mins
Decrease when player lays on bed.(Even during day time. Laying on bed is implemented.)
Well rested status gives you 20% of damage resistance. Otherwise, Fatigue gives you some debuffs depends on how tired you are.
====Dehydration====

Increase when having certain types of food, and catching on fire. (Such as eating potato, bread, rotten flesh.)
Decrease when players drink from water bottle or any kind of potions.
Dehydration gives you some debuffs depends on how dehydrated you are.
====Radiation====

Increase when players hit by creature, and eating food based on the food's radiation level.(Rotten flesh obviously does more than apples.)
Decrease when player drink from water bottle ,golden apple or any kind of potions.;
Radiation first gives you some mutation buffs like night vision. However when the level increases, the debuffs start to appear.
(This will be implemented more specifically. Like different potions decreases different amount of radiation. Now, just water and potion :). It will be configurable in the future.)
